# Global Economic Perceptions 2019–2024

## Overview
This repository contains analysis and visualizations of global economic perceptions from 2019 through 2024 using Pew Research Center's Global Attitudes Surveys. The purpose is to explore how public sentiment about the economy varies across countries and over time.

## Data
The primary data sources are the 2019 and 2024 Pew Global Attitudes Surveys, which measure public views of the national economy in multiple countries. These raw survey files are included in this repository for reference and analysis.

## Contents
- `2019 and 2024 PEW Global Attitudes Survey` files – raw survey datasets.
- `IEEE_Conference_Template.pdf` – template used for the final report.
- `Pew Research Center Global Attitudes` documents – additional documentation and data.
- `Project C.rmd` – R Markdown script used for data wrangling, analysis, and visualization.

## Analysis
The analysis is performed in R using the R Markdown file `Project C.rmd`. The script loads the survey data, cleans and transforms the responses, and generates descriptive statistics and charts. Key visualizations include comparative bar charts and line graphs to highlight changes in economic perceptions between 2019 and 2024.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `Project C.rmd` in RStudio (or run it via `rmarkdown::render`).
3. Ensure that the survey data files are located in your working directory.
4. Render the R Markdown file to produce a report with the visualizations.
